## Hello! Welcome to PC.

# PC is for everyone. It is, after all, personal.
Hey, my name is Little Mangoez, and I'm starting the PC project for personal reasons. I'm heavily inspired by Google's Material You, Work Louder, and the Car Thing from Spotify. 

What I envision is a world with less smartphone reliance, but not because they're bad, because they're not needed. When I'm in the car, I need a heads up display that will show me things I *want* to see. I love the idea of standalone hardware with companion devices that manage it. That's why PC for iOS and Mac are also being developed. PC isn't a device, it's a passion project to make something useful. It interacts in iOS as a Natural Language assistant. On the Mac, it's that and a manager for your PC device. 

# This Repository is for the PC in Python project.
I've been increasingly aware that I need another language in my arsenal: Python. This is aided by the fact that my hardware: Raspberry Pi, runs Python well. This repository is for my device experiments, *not* the apps I've developed, which are available on my GitHub profile.

I'll see you on the other side,
- Little Mangoez
